## Installation

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To install or upgrade the CLI, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g investec-ipb
```

On Windows, you may need to set your execution policy to allow running scripts. You can do this by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## Configuration

You can access your client ID, client secret, and API key from the Investec Developer Portal. More information on how to access your keys can be found on the [Investec Developer Community Wiki](https://investec.gitbook.io/programmable-banking-community-wiki/get-started/api-quick-start-guide/how-to-get-your-api-keys).

To configure the CLI, run the following command:

```sh
ipb config --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> --api-key <api-key>
```

If you want to set up specific environments for your code, you can set the environment variables in a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```env
INVESTEC_HOST=https://openapi.investec.com
INVESTEC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
INVESTEC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
INVESTEC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

You also have the option to specify the host, client ID, client secret, API key, and card ID when calling each command. These will override the configuration set in the `.env` file and your credential file:

```sh
ipb deploy -f <filename> -e <environment> -c <card-id> --host <host> --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> --api-key <api-key>
```

You can also create your own `.credentials.json` file and store and access it in a location you prefer. This file should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "card_id": "your-card-id"
}
```

To configure the CLI using a credentials file, run the following command:

```sh
ipb cards --credentials-file <path-to-credentials-file>
```

The card ID is optional and can be set when calling each command. If you specify a card when calling a command, it will override the card ID set in the configuration.

## Usage

### Cards

To get a list of your cards with card keys, card number, and whether the card is enabled for card code, run the following command:

```sh
ipb cards
```

This command retrieves detailed information about your cards, including their unique identifiers and status. It is useful for managing multiple cards and ensuring the correct card is targeted for operations.

![cards command](assets/cards.gif)

### Deploy

Deploy your code directly to your card. This command allows you to specify environment variables and target a specific card for deployment. For environment variables, you can set them in a `.env` file in the root of your project. Name your environments such as `.env.prod` or `.env.dev` and specify the environment when running the command.

To deploy code to your card, run the following command:

```sh
ipb deploy -f <filename> -e <environment> -c <card-id>
```

This command ensures that your code is uploaded securely to the specified card. It also supports environment-specific configurations to avoid accidental uploads of sensitive data.

### Fetching Execution Logs

Fetch execution logs and save them to a file. The output is in JSON format, and the file will be overwritten if it already exists. This command is essential for debugging and monitoring the behavior of your deployed code.

To fetch execution logs, run the following command:

```sh
ipb logs -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

This command retrieves logs for the specified card and saves them to the provided filename, such as `executions.json` or `logs.json`. It helps you analyze the execution flow and identify any issues.

### Run - Local Simulation

Simulate your code locally by specifying transaction details as arguments. The amount is in cents, and the currency is the ISO 4217 currency code. This command does not require an Investec account or API keys, as it runs entirely locally.

To run a transaction against your local files, use the following command:

```sh
ipb run -f main.js -e prod --amount 60000 --currency ZAR --mcc 0000 --merchant "Test Merchant" --city "Test City" --country ZA
```

This command is ideal for testing your code in a controlled environment before deploying it to a card. It provides detailed logs of the transaction and execution process.

![run command](assets/run.gif)

### New Project

To scaffold a new project, run the following command:

```sh
ipb new <project-name> --template <template-name>
```

The `template` option is optional and can be set to `default` or `petro` to create a project using one of the predefined templates. This command helps you quickly set up a project structure tailored to your needs.

![new command](assets/new.gif)

### Enable and Disable Code

To enable or disable code on your card, use the following commands:

Enable code:

```sh
ipb enable -c <card-id>
```

Disable code:

```sh
ipb disable -c <card-id>
```

These commands allow you to control whether the programmable code is active on your card. This is useful for testing or temporarily disabling functionality.

### AI Generation

Generate code for your card using AI. This feature requires an OpenAI API key, which can be set in your environment variables or a `.env` file in the root of your project.

To generate code, run the following command:

```sh
ipb ai <prompt>
```

The generated code will be saved to a file called `ai-generated.js` in the current directory. If any environment variables are required, they will be saved to a file called `.env.ai`. You can then run or deploy the generated code.

You can use my OpenAI connection to test out the AI generation by registering with the following command:

```sh
ipb register -e <email> -p <password>
```

This will create an account on ipb.sanboxpay.co.za. You will need to message in the programmable banking community to get your account activated. Channel: `#12_sandbox-playground` with your email address. Calls to the service will be logged and monitored for abuse. You will be able to use the AI generation without needing to set up your own OpenAI API key.

You will then be able to log in using the following command:

```sh
ipb login -e <email> -p <password>
```

You can now use the AI generation command to generate code for your card.

### Countries

Retrieve a list of countries that can be used in the card code:

```sh
ipb countries
```

This command provides a list of supported countries, which can be useful for setting up transactions or merchant details.

### Currencies

Retrieve a list of currencies that can be used in the card code:

```sh
ipb currencies
```

This command provides a list of supported currencies, including their ISO 4217 codes, for use in transactions.

### Merchants

Retrieve a list of merchants that can be used in the card code:

```sh
ipb merchants
```

This command provides merchant details, such as names and categories, to help you simulate or configure transactions.

### Fetch Code

To fetch the code saved on the card, run the following command:

```sh
ipb fetch -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

This command downloads the code currently saved on the card to a local file for review or backup.

![fetch command](assets/fetch.gif)

### Upload Code

```sh
ipb upload-env -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

This command uploads environment variables to the card, allowing you to configure its runtime environment.

![upload-env command](assets/upload-env.gif)

### Fetch Published Code

To fetch the published code saved on the card, run the following command:

```sh
ipb published -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

This command downloads the published version of the code from the card to a local file.

![published command](assets/published.gif)

### Publish Code

To publish code to the card, you will need the `codeId` returned when saving the code using the upload command. Run the following command:

```sh
ipb publish -f <filename> --code-id <code-id> -c <card-id>
```

This command publishes the uploaded code, making it the active version on the card.

![publish command](assets/publish.gif)

### Simulate Code

Use the online simulator to test your code without deploying it to the card. This is similar to the `run` command but uses the online simulator instead of the local emulator. Be aware that it will use your online environment and not your local environment.

```sh
ipb simulate -f main.js -c <card-key> --amount 60000 --currency ZAR --mcc 0000 --merchant "Test Merchant" --city "Test City" --country ZA
```

This command is ideal for testing your code in a production-like environment before deploying it to the card.
